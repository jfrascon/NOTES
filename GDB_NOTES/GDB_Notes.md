There is a Python interpreter built into gdb, so you can type python in the gdb's CLI and star using python right there

```
python print(gdb.breakpoints())               Check breakpoints in gbd using the built-in python
python print(gdb.breakpoints()[0].location)    
python gdb.Breakpoint('7')                    Create a breakpoint in the code using the built-in python
```

This breakpoint might be the last one statement executed in your program (swiss army trick! =)  )

```
b _exit.c:32
```

You can set breakpoints and you can have commands that are fired when those breakpoints are hit.
Example:

```
b main
breakpoint 2 at 0x400671...: file whatever.c, line 33
b _exit.c:32
breakpoint 3 at 0x7ff...: _exit.c:32

command 2
record       enable recording
continue
end

command 3
command_1   <= first  command to be executed when the breakpoint 3 is hit
command_2   <= second command to be executed when the breakpoint 3 is hit
...
command_n
end

set pagination off <= the speaker at the conference on youtube said that he turned this off because it could be annoying
```

## [SKIP INSTRUCTIONS](http://www.toptip.ca/2010/06/gdb-skip-instructions-or-lines-while.html)

Supposed you are at line 50 and you want to skip the following several lines of your source code and continue from line 60, you can input command

```
jump 60
```

However, the command **will continue your program till it meets next break point or the end of the program**.
So before you run the `jump` command, you should set a break point first.

```
b 60
j 60
```

Alternatively, if the line you want to skip is a function call, you can step into it first, and return right after.

```
s
return
```

You would need to mind the return value if the function returns something.
